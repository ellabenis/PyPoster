# __pycache__/ is a directory created by Python to cache compiled Python files.
# Since these files can be regenerated easily, they don't need to be committed to version control,
# and including them in the repository would just bloat it unnecessarily.
#
# db-data/ is a directory that would contain any data created by the database, such as its data files or logs.
# Since this data can be regenerated from the database itself, it also does not need to be committed to version control.
#
# If you don't have these directories in your project, you don't need to create them.
# They were included in the .gitignore file as a general precaution for future development, so that they are ignored in case they are ever created in the future.
